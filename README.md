Save It is a project management app that you can use locally. It is fast, and allows you to create and complete tasks. 

Save It also allows you to tag specific tasks with unique identifiers in the same management interface.

Finally, you can filter tasks by any criteria by typing on the headers of the tasks. If you want, you can do complex, multi-layered filtering from a special interface, allowing you to apply multiple filters at the same time.
